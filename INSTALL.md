## Installation steps for all the apps
1. Install [Android Studio 3.3.2](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/install/3.3.2.0/android-studio-ide-182.5314842-mac.dmg) on a Mac OS device.
2. Download Android [NDK 14](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14b-darwin-x86_64.zip) and [NDK 16](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r16b-darwin-x86_64.zip). Please note that NDK 16 is required only for _voice-engine_ project.
3. Download the [_assets_](https://github.com/XPRIZE/GLEXP-Team-KitkitSchool/releases) folder of the project.
4. Replace _cocos2d_ folder present in the _mainapp_, _bookviewer_ and _seaworld_ project with the one present in the downloaded _assets_ folder.
5. Replace the _Resources_ folder from the _assets_ with the one present in _mainapp_ project. Ensure that only one locale specific folder is present in the _localize_ folder i.e. keep either _en-us_ or _sw-tz_ folder and its related files.
6. Open the application that you are trying to build in Android Studio. Select build option under Build menu.
7. The build process may prompt to install various dependencies related to Android SDK and Build Tool. Make sure to install them.
8. Do not update _Gradle_ version used in the project, in case you are prompted to update it.
9. Install the applications from Android Studio using _Run app_ option from _Run menu_ or using the APK generated in _app/build/outputs/apk_ folder.

#### Note:
1. The _mainapp_, _seaworld_ and _bookviewer_ projects build correctly on Mac OS only. Other applications build on both Mac and Windows OS.
2. If any of the applications throw APK signing error then either comment the signing configuration from the app's gradle file or create your own _keystore_ file with the help of steps mentioned [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key).
3. _KitkitSchoolLogger_ module is among other projects.
4. Set the build variant to __debug__ for all project apps except for the _mainapp_ which is described in point 4 of FAQs below.
5. There is no need to install _cocos_ application separately for these projects.

## FAQs
1. There is a cross mark on the app cofiguration button. How do I fix that?

    >The default/main activity of the application is not set for the project. Either go to _app/build/outputs/apk_ folder and install the APK which is generated right after the build or, set the start activity in the app configuration settings of the project.

2. How to enable the _Build variant_ option in the _Build_ menu?
	>The _Build variant_ option is enabled only when the module level gradle file is opened.

3. The application throws _keystore_ file not found error. How do I fix this?

	>_keystore_ file is used to digitally sign an Android application and hence, it is not provided with the project. One must create their own _keystore_ file using the [Android keytool](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing) which comes with the Android Studio itself in order to sign the APK.

4. How to fix the the mainapp application which throws a run time error related to the package name _com.enuma.xprize_?
	> This error is caused by incorrect build variant setting for the application. Kindly, refer to the below table which has the build variant settings.
	> 
	> |App name| Build variant|
	> |--------|--------------|
	> |KitkitSchool|generalDebug-armeabi|
	> |kitkitlogger|release|
	> |libcocos2dx|debug|
	> models|debug|

5. How to fix the error for NDK not found?

	> 1. Unzip the NDK folder.
	> 2. Rename the unzipped folder to _ndk-bundle_ and place it in Android SDK's root directory.
	> 3. Ensure the _ndk-bundle_ folder contains its children files and folders.
