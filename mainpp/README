    export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="path-to-android-sdk-macosx"
    export ANT_ROOT="path-to-ant-1.9.7-or-higher"
    export NDK_ROOT="path-to-android-ndk-r10d"
    ...

"$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platforms/android-19" should point to a proper directory.
If not, consult Android SDK Manager by

    $ android

In the higher version of sdk, you might see "package org.apache.http does not exist" error. 
If you just don't want to install android-19, find 'org.apache.http.legacy.jar' in $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and copy it to 'cocos2d/cocos/platform/android/java/libs/'.


Build
-----

$ cocos2d/download_deps.py
$ cocos run -p android -j 4
