# Kitkit School 

Kitkit School consists of five apps as following:

1. Launcher 
* A home screen app, from where other apps are launched. 

2. Lock Screen 
* This app appears when the device wakes up. 
* The device will be unlocked by touching the Kitkit School icon in the middle. 

3. Library 
* A collection of videos and books for children to enjoy. 
* Video will play in place, while a separate book viewer will open to read a book. 

4. Book Viewer
* Book viewer app, which reads aloud most of books. The app will also read each word when one is touched.   

5. Main App
* Main learning app with tailored curriculum. 

The first three apps (Launcher, LockScreen, Library) are built using Android Studio, while the other two (Book Viewer and MainApp) are made upon cocos2d-x engine. 



# Build Environment #

This section describes the build environment we were using. 
Please note that we've used macOS version 10.11 and 10.12. 
It may work with other OS/Tool versions, but not verified. 


1. Download Cocos2dx-3.10
* http://www.cocos2d-x.org/filedown/cocos2d-x-3.10.zip
* Extract zip file and move the folder to ~/Documents/


2. Download Android Studio (2.2.3)
* https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
* Install Android Studio


3. Download Android NDK
* http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10d-darwin-x86.bin
* Extract bin file and move the folder to ~/Documents/


4. Download Apache Ant
* http://mirror.symnds.com/software/Apache//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.9.8-bin.zip
* Extract zip file and move the folder to ~/Documents/


5. Download Java SE Runtime 1.8
* http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u112-b16/jdk-8u112-macosx-x64.dmg
* Install JRE 8u112
* /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8


6. Run cocos setup
* ~/Documents/cocos2d-x-3.10/setup.py
* add NDK Root /Users/xxxxx/Documents/android-ndk-r10d
* add SDK Root /Users/xxxxx/Library/Android/sdk
* add ANT Root /Users/xxxxx/Documents/apache-ant-1.9.8/bin


7. Add UTF-8 Settings to bash_profile
* vi ~/.bash_profile
* add two lines
* export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
* export LANG=en_US.UTF-8



# Copy Resources Files #

Now the environment is setup, but we are not ready to build the apps yet.  
Due to the large amount of resources, we could not put all the necessary resources into Githug. Instead, they are stored in Box folder. 

1. Library
* target directory is library/app/src/main/assets
* copy files from resources/library/en/assets into the target directory for English version
* copy files from resources/library/sw/assets into the target directory for Swahili version

2. Book Viewer
* target directory is bookviewer/Resources
* copy files from resources/bookviewer/Resources into the target directory

3. Main App
* target directory is mainapp/Resources
* copy files from resources/mainapp/Resources into the target directory
* also copy pre-built library from resources/mainapp/cocos2d to mainapp/cocos2d



# Build APKs #


1. Apps built with Android Studio (Launcher, Lock Screen, Library) 

We have to build unsigned-release APKs for Android Studio based apps. 
One way to do this is, 
- open the "Build Variants" tab at left-bottom
- set the 'Build Variant' to release
- from the top menu, choose Build > Build APK

Another way is to create a Gradle task by 
- open Run/Debug Configuration menu by press "app" button on the menu bar, then choose "Edit Configuration"
- add a Gradle Task and give a name like "assemble" 
- run the task 

The resulting APK will be generated in app/build/outputs/apk/[appname]-release-unsigned.apk


2. Apps based on cocos2d-x (Book Viewer, Main App) 

For those apps, a command line tool is used to generate signed-release APKs. 
The key is pushed to Github - if you want to use your own key, change the keystore and proj.android/ant.properties

The command is simple: 
> cocos compile -p android -m release

in each app's directory. 

APK will be generated in bin/release/android



# Language Settings #

Some apps need to change a few lines of the source code or resource files to build a binary for the other language. 


1. Launcher and Lock Screen 
* They look at the system language and use the localized string accordingly, so you just need one binary for both languages. 

2. Library 
* As mentioned in the previous section, the whole assets need to be replaced 
    * resources/library/en/assets -> library/app/src/main/assets for English
    * resources/library/sw/assets -> library/app/src/main/assets for Swahili

3. Book Viewer
* change line 7 of Classes/MainScene.h
    * for English
    > #define IS_ENGLISH (true)
    
    * for Swahili
    > #define IS_ENGLISH (false)


4. Main App
* change line 31 of Classes/Managers/LanguageManager.cpp
    * for English
    > auto defaultLang = LanguageType::ENGLISH;

    * for Swahili
    > auto defaultLang = LanguageType::SWAHILI;



# Build AOSP to make image #

With all the APKs, it is time to build an image. 
We used a machine with ubuntu 16.04 LTS for that purpose. 



1.
Follow this 
https://source.android.com/source/requirements.html
https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html
https://source.android.com/source/building.html
need at least 150G of empty space. 

2.
make a folder to <aosp root>/package/app/<app name>
: BookTest / TodoSchool / TodoSchoolLauncher / TodoSchoolLibrary / TodoSchoolLockScreen

put *.apk file to the folder and make Android.mk and fill with

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := optional
LOCAL_MODULE := < your app folder name >
LOCAL_CERTIFICATE := < desired key >
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := < app apk filename >
LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS := APPS
LOCAL_MODULE_SUFFIX := $(COMMON_ANDROID_PACKAGE_SUFFIX)
include $(BUILD_PREBUILT)

#< desired key > for BookTest and TodoSchool : presigned
#< desired key > for TodoSchoolLibrary and TodoSchoolLockScreen : shared
#< desired key > for TodoSchoolLauncher : package

to put the apk in the /data/app, add this line
LOCAL_MODULE_PATH := $(TARGET_OUT_DATA)/app

for system privileged app add this line (apk will be in /system/priv-app)
LOCAL_PRIVILEGED_MODULE := true 

step 3.
edit device/google/dragon/device.mk
add package name to 
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += < package name >

step 4.
to create userdata.img
edit device/google/dragon/BoardConfig.mk
add 

#userdata
#for 32GB device
BOARD_USERDATAIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE := 26557284352
#for 64GB device
#BOARD_USERDATAIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE := 57825820672
#TARGET_USERIMAGES_SPARSE_EXT_DISABLED := true

step 5.
test by doing following
https://source.android.com/source/running.html
