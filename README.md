# Kitkit School

Kitkit School (phase 3) consists of 12 apps as following:

1. Launcher
* A home screen app, from where other apps are launched.

2. Lock Screen
* This app appears when the device wakes up.
* The device will be unlocked by touching the Kitkit School icon in the middle.

3. Library
* A collection of videos and books for children to enjoy.
* Video will play in place, while a separate book viewer will open to read a book.

4. Book Viewer
* Book viewer app, which reads aloud most of books. The app will also read each word when one is touched.   

5. Main App
* Main learning app with tailored curriculum.

6. Blackboard
7. Drawing
8. Drum
9. Marimba
10. Writing Board
11. Sea World
12. Voice Engine (for English only) 
* Additional tools/toys as rewards

Most of the apps above share code from kitkitshcoollogger

13. KitkitSchoolLogger
* not a stand-alone app, but the code is shared among other apps


Book Viewer and MainApp are made upon cocos2d-x engine, while others are native Android apps written in Java


# Build Environment #

This section describes the build environment we were using.
Please note that we've used macOS version 10.11 and 10.12.
It may work with other OS/Tool versions, but not verified.




1. Download Android Studio (2.2.3)
* https://developer.android.com/studio/archive
* Install Android Studio


2. Download Android NDK (r14b, except for voice-engine which uses r16b) 
* https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.html
* https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14b-darwin-x86_64.zip
* https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r16b-darwin-x86_64.zip
* Extract bin file and move the folder to ~/Documents/


3. Download Apache Ant
* https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/
* https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.9.8-bin.zip
* Extract zip file and move the folder to ~/Documents/


4. Download Java SE Runtime 1.8
* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html
* Install JRE 8u112
* /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8


5. Add UTF-8 Settings to bash_profile
* vi ~/.bash_profile
* add two lines
* export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
* export LANG=en_US.UTF-8



# Copy Resources/Engine Files #

Now the environment is setup, but we are not ready to build the apps yet.  
Due to the large amount of resources, we could not put all the necessary resources into Githug. Instead, they are stored in Box folder.

1. library.tar.gz
* used by library
* target directory is library/localized
* in the "localized" folder, leave only the language to build, to minimize the build time and the binary size

2. mainapp.tar.gz
* used by mainapp
* target directory is mainapp/Resources
* in the "Resources/localized" folder, leave only the language to build, to minimize the build time and the binary size
* this resource files are also used by bookviewer, so these two projects (mainapp and bookviewer) need to in the same folder, side by side) 

3. cocos2d.tar.gz
* used by mainapp, bookviewer, seaworld
* overwrite "mainapp/cocos2d", "bookviewer/cocos2d", "seaworld/cocos2d" folder with the inflated cocos2d folder




# Build APKs #


Build with Android Studio 

- don't forget to set the NDK folder
- set the appropriate 'Build Variant' 
   - mainapp : generalDebug
   - launcher, library, bookviewer : swahiliDebug or englishUSDebug (or englishDebug)
   - others : debug
- build variant of kitkitlogger will be set automatically (release)
- from the top menu, choose Build > Build APK

The resulting APK will be generated in app/build/outputs/apk/[appname]-[language]-debug.apk



# Build AOSP to make image #

With all the APKs, it is time to build an image.
We used a machine with ubuntu 16.04 LTS for that purpose.



1.
Follow this
https://source.android.com/source/requirements.html
https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html
https://source.android.com/source/building.html
need at least 150G of empty space.

2.
all the apps are signed with the platform key
only mainapp will be installed in userdata.img, while other apps will be placed in system.img

make a folder to <aosp root>/package/app/<app name>

put *.apk file to the folder and make Android.mk and fill with

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := optional
LOCAL_MODULE := < your app folder name >
LOCAL_CERTIFICATE := platform
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := < app apk filename >
LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS := APPS
LOCAL_MODULE_SUFFIX := $(COMMON_ANDROID_PACKAGE_SUFFIX)
include $(BUILD_PREBUILT)

#< desired key > for BookTest and TodoSchool : presigned
#< desired key > for TodoSchoolLibrary and TodoSchoolLockScreen : shared
#< desired key > for TodoSchoolLauncher : package

to put the apk in the /data/app, add this line
LOCAL_MODULE_PATH := $(TARGET_OUT_DATA)/app

for system privileged app add this line (apk will be in /system/priv-app)
LOCAL_PRIVILEGED_MODULE := true

step 3.
edit device/google/dragon/device.mk
add package name to
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += < package name >

step 4.
to create userdata.img
edit device/google/dragon/BoardConfig.mk
add

#userdata
#for 32GB device
BOARD_USERDATAIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE := 26557284352
#for 64GB device
#BOARD_USERDATAIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE := 57825820672
#TARGET_USERIMAGES_SPARSE_EXT_DISABLED := true

step 5.
test by doing following
https://source.android.com/source/running.html

Troubleshooting

Fix for Xcode 8 or newer
Download Xcode 7.3 and copy and paste MacOSX10.11.sdk to <Xcode8 or newer.app>/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/
